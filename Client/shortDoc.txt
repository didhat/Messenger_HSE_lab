DataBaseConfiguration - db configuration at startup;
DataBaseController = some functions for working with db;
GlobalConfigs - global variables;
InputForm - it is rubbish from old version, but it has one useful function;
RequestHandler - everything for working with sockets;
StartConfiguration - setting global variables, etc;
structures - hmm... It is obvious;
UserInterface - upper level user's command handler

All commands:
    /friends - show your friends list(old command from the oldest version, recommended to use /show friends);
    /add friend - add new friend (you can add anyone, even unregistered users);
    /dell friend - remove user from friends list;
    /dell dialog - remove dialog with user (Also worth mentioning, that dialogue isn't deleted from another user, messages also remain on the server archive);
    /send mess - send a message to someone (at the end of the message you should write "/end");
    /show friends - show your friend list;
    /show dialogs - show your dialog list;
    /show dialog show your dialog with somebody;
